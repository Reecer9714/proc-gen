# Locations
There are four types of locations a player may interact with: Towns, Dungeons, Landmarks, Encounters
## Towns
No need to require navigation around, just generates what is available in the town
## Dungeons
Nested Rooms with random connections
## Landmarks
Single area with some event or encounter
## Encounters
Just some combat or social encounter where location is not important
